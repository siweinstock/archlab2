Q1
1) r[4]=12+45=57
   r[5]=45-r[4]= 45-57=-12
   r[2]=12, r[3]=45 unchanged
2) you can only write to new register and read from ole register, in the following code there is an attempt to read from a new register and write to an old register.

Q2

1) It will take 6n clock cycles to execute n instructions because each instructions is executed by going through all states in the state machine.
2) Theoretically, it is possible to design it so that all stages happen in the same clock cycle, and this way it would support memory access at every click cycle.
Of course this is not a good solution because it would make the clock cycle 6 times longer. In the proposed solution memory access at every clock cycle is not supported, every reading from memory takes at least 2 clock cycles and they dont happen paralelly.
3) Adventages:
Easy to implement
No hazards that occure from pipelining and dependencies between differen instructions
Disadventages:
At any point of time, only a 1/6 of the cpu is actively processing data
Some instructions dont require all 6 states and still are being executed in 6 clock cycles each.
